====INTRODUCTION====

	This is a basic Keylogger made in C. It uses socket programming to setup a way to send packets with the client's pressed keys back to the "server" or host. It is made for windows, and will not work with other OS's. It hasn't been fully editted and may leak lots of memory and corrupt your files, be vigilant before using.



====PRE-CAUTIONS====

	This is still a work in progress. I am new to C and this isn't intended to be a fully working Keylogger for you to use. Also, don't use this for malicious purposes, that is unethical, and the only purpose of this repo is to educate other about basic windows functions and to show beginner C ideas/methods. If you do use it without knowledge about digital traces/footprints on someone else's unsuspecting computer, you will likely be exposing your info to bad people, and law enforcement.
